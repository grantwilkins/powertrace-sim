It is not a special character in the string; it's just part of the variable name. The `@`-prefixed syntax is a way to refer to variables in the template. The `@` is not part of the string; it's a syntax marker. So the answer: It's just a syntax marker for variable names, not a special character in the string. It indicates that the following text is a variable name. It is not part of the string. The `@` is used to differentiate variable names from other text. So the answer: It's just a syntax marker. It doesn't have any special meaning beyond that. It is not part of the string. It is used to denote a variable. So the answer: It's just a syntax marker. It doesn't have any special meaning",

However, the text you provided is a bit garbled and contains a mix of unrelated content. Let's clarify what you need and how to create a custom function in Google Sheets using Google Apps Script.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Custom Function in Google Sheets\n\n#### 1. Open Google Sheets\n- Open the Google Sheets document where you want to add the custom function.\n\n#### 2. Open the Script Editor\n- Click on `Extensions` in the top menu.\n- Select `Apps Script`. This will open the Google Apps Script editor in a new tab.\n\n#### 3. Write Your Custom Function\n- In the script editor, you can write a custom function. For example, let's create a function that calculates the sum of two numbers and adds a custom message.\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Adds two numbers and returns a custom message.\n *\n * @param {number} num1 The first number.\n * @param {number} num2 The second number.\n * @return The sum of the two numbers with a custom message.\n * @customfunction\n */\nfunction addWithMessage(num1, num2) {\n  var sum = num1 + num2;\n  return \"The sum of \" + num1 + \" and \" + num2 + \" is \" + sum + \".\";\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Save the Script\n- Click the disk icon or press `Ctrl + S` (Windows) or `Cmd + S` (Mac) to save the script. You can name the project if prompted.\n\n#### 5. Use the Custom Function in Google Sheets\n- Go back to your Google Sheets document.\n- In",
