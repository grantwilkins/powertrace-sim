Output: the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.\n\nWe need to handle negative numbers: if all negative, the maximum sum is the largest (least negative) number.\n\nWe can use Kadane's algorithm: iterate over array, maintain current sum and max sum. For each element x: current = max(x, current + x); maxSum = max(maxSum, current). Initialize current = 0? Actually if we initialize current = 0 and maxSum = -inf, it works. But if we initialize current = arr[0], maxSum = arr[0], then loop from i=1.\n\nEdge cases: N=0? But N is at least 1? Problem says N is number of elements. Usually N >= 1.
