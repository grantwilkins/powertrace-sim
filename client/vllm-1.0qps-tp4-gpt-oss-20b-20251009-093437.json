A splash screen is typically a screen that displays when the scene or game\n\nIt looks like you're interested in creating a splash or loading screen in Unity. A splash screen is a common feature in many games and applications, providing a brief visual introduction or loading indicator while the main content is being prepared. Here's a general guide on how you can create a splash screen in Unity:\n\n### 1. Create a Splash Screen Scene\n\n1. **Create a New Scene**: In Unity, create a new scene that will serve as your splash screen. This scene should contain the elements you want to display during the loading process.\n\n2. **Add UI Elements**: Add UI elements such as a logo, loading bar, or any other visual elements you want to display on the splash screen.\n\n3. **Set Up a Canvas**: Ensure that your UI elements are placed on a Canvas. This is essential for proper rendering of UI elements.\n\n### 2. Create a Loading Script\n\n1. **Create a Script**: Create a new C# script in Unity. This script will handle the loading process and transition to the main scene.\n\n2. **Implement Loading Logic**: In the script, implement the logic for loading your main scene asynchronously. Unity provides the `SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync",

The user wants to know if they can create a new tenant with the same name or if they need to delete the existing tenant first. Here's a possible response:\n\n---\n\n**Response:**\n\nIt looks like you're encountering a conflict because there's already a tenant with the same name in the system. In most cases, the system will not allow you to create a new tenant with the same name to avoid confusion and potential data conflicts.\n\nHere are a few options you can consider:\n\n1. **Delete the Existing Tenant:**\n   - If you no longer need the existing tenant, you can delete it. This will free up the name for use by a new tenant. However, be cautious as this action might result in the loss of data associated with the existing tenant.\n\n2. **Rename the New Tenant:**\n   - If you want to keep both tenants, consider giving the new tenant a different name. This way, you can avoid naming conflicts and maintain separate data for each tenant.\n\n3. **Check for Existing Tenants:**\n   - Before creating a new tenant, you can check if a tenant with the same name already exists. This can be done by querying the system or using an API call to retrieve a list of existing tenants. If a tenant with the same name is found, you can decide whether to delete it or rename the new tenant.\n\n4. **Contact Support:**\n   - If you're unsure about the best course of action or if you need assistance with deleting or renaming tenants, consider reaching out to the system's support team. They can provide guidance and help you navigate the process.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further assistance or if you'd like me to walk you through any of these steps.\n\nIt seems like you're looking for a way to handle a situation where a user is trying to create a new tenant with the same name as an existing one.

The only way to get a 3\u2011digit number is to use the 3\u2011digit number 100. So the only possible values for the product are 10 and 100.

But maybe the puzzle expects the answer: \"10\" because it's the only product that can be obtained by using the 2-digit number 10 and the 3-digit number 1. But the 3-digit number 1 is not 3-digit.

So no.\n\nThus the puzzle is unsolvable.\n\nBut maybe the puzzle expects the answer: \"There is no such product.\" So the answer: \"No product exists.\" That might be the trick: The puzzle is impossible, so the answer is \"No product exists.\" But the puzzle might be a trick: The only product that can be obtained is 10,",
